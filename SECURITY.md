# ⚠️ Reporting a Vulnerability

We strive to produce code of the highest possible quality without any vulnerabilities,
so that your experience is risk-free.

However, if you happen to detect such a vulnerability in the code, or if you are aware
of a vulnerability in a package on which this code is based (see 
[the requirements list](https://github.com/bqth29/simulated-bifurcation-algorithm/blob/main/requirements.txt)),
please inform us immediately. To do so, you have to possibilities:
- either by opening an [issue](https://github.com/bqth29/simulated-bifurcation-algorithm/issues)
  with the prefix [VULNERABILITY]
- either by contacting us through the
  [_Show and tell_](https://github.com/bqth29/simulated-bifurcation-algorithm/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)
  section of our discussions space with the word VULNERABILITY explicitly present in the
  subject's title

We will immediately investigate the situation and try to remedy the problem. We thank you in advance.
